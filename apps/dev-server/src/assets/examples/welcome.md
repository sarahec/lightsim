# Welcome to Lightsim

Lightsim is a lighweight tool for writing educational simulations. Creating branching simulations is as easy as writing
a letter -- the headings in the page turn into simulation screens, and the links turn into navigation. As you wish to 
go deeper, special notes in the text enable more sophisticated branching, tasks that need to be completed to unlock
sections, and more.

## Authoring documents

Lightsim uses [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/), to create formatted documents from plain text.
