# This is a test

The lightsim compiler will convert this document into a series of pages.

***Note:*** *The page title should be "Demo Sim". This comes from the frontmatter.*

## This is only a test

::title[Test]

This page will be used to try out new content types to see the generated content

***Note:*** *The page title should be "Test". This comes from a local directive.*

### Examples

1. A plain slideshow site
2. A simple branching sim, but with helpful debugging tools
3. A conditional branching site

## This concludes the test

Thank you for reading.
